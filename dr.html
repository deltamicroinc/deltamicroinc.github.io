				<h2>Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>

						<img src="images/dr.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
						<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease associated with diabetes. It is a leading cause of blindness in the working-age adults in the world. The risk of DR increases as the longer a person has diabetes; it is estimated to affect up to 80% of the patients who have had diabetes 20 years and more. Moreover, patients with DR usually have no symptoms until the very late stages, by which time it may be too late for effective treatment. Therefore, it is important to conduct DR screening regularly for patients with diabetes. The American Academy of Ophthalmology, American Optometric Association, and American Diabetes Association recommend routine, and annual eye examination for patients with diabetes. </p>
						<p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that the DR screening is beneficial for the early diagnosis and treatment of DR, which can ultimately slow down or avert the progression of vision impairment. However, the early diagnosis of DR is difficult because of the appearance of few or subtle symptoms and the limit resources in trained clinicians and equipment. Especially, the expertise and equipment required are often lacking in urban areas and underdeveloped and developing countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing a portable retinal camera and an automated software system for DR screening.</p>
						<p>At Delta Micro Technology Inc., our team is dedicated to developing a hardware and software system for effective and efficient DR screening. Specifically, we focus on developing a multi-purpose retinal camera and an automated image analysis cloud platform for DR diagnosis. Our multi-purpose retinal camera can be used in both desktop and hand-hold settings, which yields its flexibility in different applications, such as in big cities, urban regions, or even mobile medical unit. Our automated image analysis cloud platform conducts retinal image analysis by using the latest image processing and deep learning techniques to improve the expertise’s ability to DR grade and save their time in image reading. </p>
